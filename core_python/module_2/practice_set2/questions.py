# Question 1:  write a python program to add two numbers.
num1 = 6
num2 = 7

summation = num1 + num2
print("summation of these number is: ", summation)

# Question 2: write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by 2.
print("remainder is: ", (num2 % 2))  # here (%)is modulus_operator

# Question 3:  check the type of the variable assigned using input()
# user_input = input("Enter a number here: ")
user_input = "45song"
print("variable_type is: ", type(user_input))

# Question 4:   use comparison operator to find out whether a given variable 'a' is greater than 'b' or not.
print(num1 > num2)

# Question 5:   write a python program to calculate average and square of two number entered by the user.
print("average of these number is: ", round((num1 + num2) / 2, 2))  # it will print the two digit after the decimal.

print("square of the number is: ", num2 ** 2)
